# Project: ASCII Text Signature
### About:
When learning a new programming language, we always have to figure out how to print text data. It is a simple and useful skill: you can print texts everywhere, even in the console. There is only one problem: the text itself isn’t pretty enough for your taste. What if we try to add a little “make-up”? Or get very creative with fonts, draw awesome letters with other letters? Let’s try this out.
### Learning outcomes
You will learn to use the famous triad: for, while, and when, and also take a glance at functions and files.
### This project is a part of the following learning goals:
