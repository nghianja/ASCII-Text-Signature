<h2 style="text-align: center;">Description</h2>

<p>Let's change the font of the text. The new font will be larger. It will consist of multiple rows and columns of standard console symbols.</p>

<p>The new font is shown below:</p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">
____ ___  ____ ___  ____ ____ ____ _  _ _  _ _  _ _    _  _
|__| |__] |    |  \ |___ |___ | __ |__| |  | |_/  |    |\/|
|  | |__] |___ |__/ |___ |    |__] |  | | _| | \_ |___ |  |
_  _ ____ ___  ____ ____ ____ ___ _  _ _  _ _ _ _ _  _ _   _ ___ 
|\ | |  | |__] |  | |__/ [__   |  |  | |  | | | |  \/   \_/    / 
| \| |__| |    |_\| |  \ ___]  |  |__|  \/  |_|_| _/\_   |    /__

</code></pre>

<p>This font consists of the symbols <code>'_', '|', '/', '\', ']', '['</code>. Note that there are no lowercase letters, only uppercase, so you should print all symbols in uppercase.</p>

<p>Note that the width of the letters in this font is different. For example, for the letter <code>T</code> it is 3 characters, for the letter <code>Y</code> it is 5 characters. You can find the letter boundaries by determining spaces in the same positions in all three lines of the font.</p>

<p>Also, each signature should contain the status of the person. It can be "VIP", "Worker", "Speaker", "Administrator", "Participant", or something else. These statuses should appear on the signature, below the person's name. This information is not as important as the person’s name, so it should be generated in a smaller font.</p>

<p>To be successfully readable, every symbol of this font should be separated by a column of spaces.</p>

<p>You may notice that there is no space among these symbols. As shown in the example below, you should consider space is 4-symbols wide (not including spaces between symbols and 6-symbols wide including spaces between symbols).</p>

<p>Also, from the border to the start of the name (or status, in case it is longer than the name) there should be exactly two spaces on both sides.</p>

<p>Also, it may happen that the width of the signature has an even number of symbols but status has an odd number of symbols (or vice versa). In this case, you cannot generate a status right in the middle - there always would be an offset by one - on the left or on the right. In this scenario, your program should put the status to the left so there would be 1 fewer number of spaces to the left rather than to the right of the status.</p>
