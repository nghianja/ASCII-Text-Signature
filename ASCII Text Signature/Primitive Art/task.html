<p>An ASCII generator is an awesome thing. It can output to the real world any document, picture, or text file, all in two-dimensions containing only text symbols. It is often used to print signatures for various conferences and meetings. A signature can be like a name badge is a small piece of paper with your name printed on it which lets everyone know what your name is. In this project, you will write an ASCII generator that can print name signatures.</p>

<p>Let's start with generating the simplest signature. A signature usually consists of a name and a surname. Your task is to generate to the output signature displaying the name of someone named "Hyper" with a surname "Skill". Also, you need the text to be bordered with straight lines across all four sides like in the example.</p>

<p>Note that left and right borders consist of the symbol <code>'|'</code>, the top border consists of the symbol <code>'_'</code>, and the bottom border consists of the symbol <code>'¯'</code>.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Output example</h2>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight"> _____________
| Hyper Skill |
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯</code></pre>
